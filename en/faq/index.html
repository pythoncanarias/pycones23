<p>After selecting a sponsorship plan, you will be able to additionally choose
elements to support the conference independently, such as "Interviews" or
"Breastfeeding Room".</p>
<p>That means that you will be supporting the conference by paying for the plan
you have chosen, plus these independent elements (with limited spaces) for
specific activities.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you need to choose a sponsorship plan before choosing the
Add-ons, from the simplest (Timanfaya) to the most complete (Teide).</p>

<p><strong>4 tickets</strong> are reserved for sponsors with a discount associated with the
level of Sponsorship.</p>
<p>Sponsoring companies or institutions will receive a special link to purchase
tickets with their respective discount.</p>
<p>If a company is interested in bringing more people, attention should be paid to
the <strong>general batch</strong> of ticket sales.</p>

<p>If in your case you need an invoice to present it to the entity that is
covering your attendance at the event, we will generate your invoice when the
event takes place or until the deadline to change the details of the conference
tickets. Mainly, due to the complexity of canceling said documents in our
