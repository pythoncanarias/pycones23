<p>Python Spain, as an association around which different types of events are
organized, wants to ensure that all the people who participate in said events
or communications have a professional and positive learning, collaboration or
leisure experience. For this, it is expected that whoever participates in the
community shows respect and courtesy towards the rest.</p>

a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience , education, socioeconomic status,
national origin, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity or
orientation.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct details what behaviors are expected, what is rejected and
what mechanisms exist to help a person who is being subjected to inappropriate
behavior.</p>
<h2 id="why-a-code-of-conduct">Why a code of conduct?</h2>

expected of the environment in any Python Spain event:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let more people know they are welcome</li>
<li>Avoid ambiguities</li>
<li>Build a climate of trust, where if someone wants to report an incident, they</li>
<li>know that we will not start by questioning them (victim blaming).</li>
</ul>

the Python Spain community, whether online or in person. It also applies to

  as a whole</li>
<li>Use language that is inclusive and accommodates a diverse audience</li>
<li>Pay special attention to people who are new to the community</li>
