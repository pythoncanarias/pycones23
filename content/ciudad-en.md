## "La Laguna"

[San Cristóbal de La Laguna](https://turismo.aytolalaguna.es/), better known as
La Laguna, is the second most populous city in Tenerife and the third in the
Canary Islands. It is located in the northeast of the island of Tenerife, next
to the capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and is part of the metropolitan area.

The city was declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1999 for being
a unique example of an unwalled colonial city. Its name comes from the fact
that it was built on an old lagoon that existed in the area.

Historically, the Canary Islands have been a strategic point -cultural, social
and economic- between Europe and Latin America.
