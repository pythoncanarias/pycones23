# Code of Conduct

Python Spain, as an association around which different types of events are
organized, wants to ensure that all the people who participate in said events
or communications have a professional and positive learning, collaboration or
leisure experience. For this, it is expected that whoever participates in the
community shows respect and courtesy towards the rest.

By participating in the Python Spain community, you commit to promoting
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience , education, socioeconomic status,
national origin, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity or
orientation.

This Code of Conduct details what behaviors are expected, what is rejected and
what mechanisms exist to help a person who is being subjected to inappropriate
behavior.

## Why a code of conduct?

Sticking with Python zen, explicit better than implicit. Explain what is
expected of the environment in any Python Spain event:

* Let more people know they are welcome
* Avoid ambiguities
* Build a climate of trust, where if someone wants to report an incident, they
* know that we will not start by questioning them (victim blaming).

## Scope

This code of conduct is applicable to all people who participate in spaces of
the Python Spain community, whether online or in person. It also applies to
public spaces where a person is representing the community. Examples of the
latter include the use of the official email account, publications through
official social networks, or presentations with designated persons at online or
offline events.  Our standards

  as a whole

  that there is clear and unbiased communication
