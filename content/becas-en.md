# Diversidad y Becas

At PyConES 2023, we are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion at our conference. We firmly believe in the importance of creating an inclusive and respectful environment that encourages the participation of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, age, abilities, religion, or sexual orientation. We also care about providing an inclusive environment for those with parental responsibilities.

To ensure diversity at our conference, we have implemented various initiatives, some of which include:


* **Diversity Tickets**: 
  
    We offer opportunities for women and LGBTQ+ individuals with specific circumstances, granting them the chance to attend PyConES.  
    
    These tickets are awarded through an active application process until 15th August: [¡Quiero solicitar una Entrada de Diversidad!](https://forms.gle/dAtJyaBGVAYa6mou5)


* **Scholarships**: 
    
    With scholarships, our aim is to remove economic barriers, facilitating the participation of those who might face financial difficulties in attending the event. 
    
    These scholarships are awarded through an active application process until August 15th: [¡Quiero Solicitar una Beca!](https://forms.gle/bW7iPDeAYypHx1pF9)


* **Ludoteca (Childcare)**: 
    
    We have created a dedicated space where parents can leave their children while they attend talks and workshops.

* **Breastfeeding Room:**:
    
    We have set up a private space dedicated to breastfeeding, making every effort to meet the basic needs and provide comfort to those who require it.

* **Silence or Quiet Room**:

    We have arranged a room for recharging and resting, providing a safe and tranquil space for individuals who may quickly become overwhelmed in social settings or easily overstimulated. This way, we ensure all participants can fully enjoy talks and networking without feeling overwhelmed.

		
* **Django Girls Programming Workshop for Women**: 
  
    The workshop is aimed at the local community and conference attendees who wish to participate, our way of giving back and showing gratitude to the local community that welcomes the conference.
    
    This workshop offers a safe and supportive environment where participants can experience their first encounter with programming and connect with other professionals in the field.
    
    Pre-registration is required; more details coming soon.

* **Código de Conducta**: 

    We have a Code of Conduct in place to ensure a respectful and safe environment for all attendees. You can review it at the following link: [Code of Conduct](https://2023.es.pycon.org/codigo_conducta/). 


We are proud to be part of a broader movement that promotes diversity in technology. In the conference organizing team, we have leaders and participants from the  *[AdaLoveDev](https://twitter.com/adalovedev)*, *[PyLadies España](https://twitter.com/PyLadiesES)* and *[Women Techmakers](https://twitter.com/wtmbcn)* communities.

From the Organizing Team: [Python Canarias](https://pythoncanarias.es/), [Python España](https://es.python.org/) and [volunteers]() of PyConEs23 endorse the [PSF]()manifesto[¹] and value diversity in all its forms. We believe that the inclusion of different perspectives enriches our community and improves our field. We will continue to strive to promote diversity and ensure that all individuals feel welcome and represented at our conference.
