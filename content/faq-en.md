<summary>I want to sponsor but how do the add-ons work?</summary>
This year we have added a new modality to Sponsorships, Add-ons.

After selecting a sponsorship plan, you will be able to additionally choose
elements to support the conference independently, such as "Interviews" or
"Breastfeeding Room".

That means that you will be supporting the conference by paying for the plan
you have chosen, plus these independent elements (with limited spaces) for
specific activities.

Keep in mind, you need to choose a sponsorship plan before choosing the
Add-ons, from the simplest (Timanfaya) to the most complete (Teide).
