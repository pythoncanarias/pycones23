## Recommendations for your proposal

We want to motivate people with different levels of experience in presentations
to participate in the conference. We know that for people who are just starting out,
presenting an idea that reflects all the great details that your talk has
can be a bit confusing.

It is important that you present your idea clearly, but that you can also
give the necessary information so that reviewers understand your proposal.

### Structure of your abstract

A simple structure that you can follow is to be able to contemplate the following
points in your proposal:

* Context of your talk or problem
* Definition of the problem
* Why is it important to find a solution to that problem?
* What will be discussed and what will the people who attend learn?
* Previous requirements or additional comments of your talk

Avoid abstracts of one or two lines that repeat the idea that is already presented
in the title, and try to include factors that make your proposal
**special and unique!**.
